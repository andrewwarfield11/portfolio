                    Computer Science concepts, such as simple algorithms and data structures, to new Computer Science students. Since I have
                    graduated and no long have access to the Hololens we worked with, I unfortunately have a limited number of screenshots I
                    can use from the Hololens itself, but below are the screenshots from the AVL tree and binary search tutorials as someone
                    using the app would see them.

                    sort tutorials. These are the tutorials that I worked on the most personally. The application does not look quite as
                    good in Unity as it does on the Hololens itself, but it is still perfectly functional.

                    pop or peek from an empty stack, then actually push the new node to the stack. Pop will show an error if the stack is 
                    empty, otherwise destroy the head value. Peek will also show an error if the stack is empty, and otherwise it will

                <p>This project is an implementation of AES in C. It was originally designed to work with Travis CI as an autograder, but 
                    the following is the output of a test file using simple, standard test parameters for the message and the key. This 
                    implementation will however work with any size message for 128, 192, or 256 bit AES encryption.

                <p>This snippet shows what happens at the beginning of this implementation of aes. The init function will len, which 
                    is the size of the key, to set the key length and number of rounds. Len is measured in bytes, so if it is 16 that 
                    means you are using 128 bit encryption, which means there will be 10 rounds. If len is 24, you are using 192 bit 
                    encryption and need 12 rounds. If len 32, you are using 256 bit encryption and need 14 rounds. The key length in this 
                    implementation is measured in units of 32 bit words, or 4 byte words. This means that the value used will always be len/4.
                    Key expansion will then be called, which will then expand the key so that you have one 32 bit word for each of the rounds.

                <p>This is an encrypted chat application made in java using AES encryption and a custom security provider. It uses Diffie
                Hellman Key Exchange to safely generate and exchange the keys. The first screenshot shows the server side of the chat and the 
                second shows the client side.</p>

                <p>The most important part of this chat application was the key exchange itself. The snippets below contrast the slightly 
                    different steps that the server and client take in order to perform the key exchange. I decided to have the server 
                    generate both the parameters for the key exchange and the IV (the initialization vector for the cipher block chain), 
                    and the client receive both of them.
